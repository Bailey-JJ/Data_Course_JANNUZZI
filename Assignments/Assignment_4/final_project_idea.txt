My idea for the final project is to track meteor events and making them into a map marking locations of impact, along with other data such as size, mass, compounds (if available). I also have a separate dataset on specifically bolides, tracking their impact energy, geolocation, brightness, date of peak brightness, and velocity. I would like to learn about the frequency of meteors by year, location frequency, possibly correlation with specific meteor showers, and comparing bolide brightness to velocity and impact energy.

Taking data from NASA meteorite landing dataset to build the map and the additional analysis of other observed variables. I also possibly plan on using a separate dataset on astrological events like meteor showers, to see any correlation with number of landings, and locations of landings.

I plan on using data from NASA and the IAU Meteor Data Center.
