# Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

predict(mod4, new_mushroom)

  # all the values from the best model (mod4) have some scientific meaning, there are no 
  # impossible values and all response values overlap areas where the Actual Model
  # has points plotted as well, meaning they have at least some scientific meaning.


# In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
  # Yes, some did not have linear relationships.

# Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
